# Javier-Martinez-Portfolio

## Description

The project for this week was to create a portfolio website that has information about myself, my work, and contact information This portfolio was designed to provide future employers look at my completed work and thought process for how I work on a project. The portfolio starts with My name, then gives a navigation bar to take the user to the area of the website they need to observe. After the nav bar are my work projects with links that take the users directly to the project themselves. After comes the section that provides information on how to contact me. Finally at the bottom is where you'll find the resume section (Resume to be included soon). Problems that I solved while working on this project had to do with media queries, getting the right size for my work to fit the screen. What I learned from this project is that I need to improve on my understanding of some of the css properties in order utilize them for future projects.   

## Installation

I started with creating a new repository git hub for the remote repository, after I cloned the repository from github to make a local repository. Then I added an index.html file, an assets with a css file inside on vs code and pushed them to the remote repository on github. First using the gitpull command to make sure the repositories were up to date, then using the git add, commit, then push command to add all the extra files that I added from gitbash.  

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.
