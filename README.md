# Javier-Martinez-Portfolio

## Description

The project for this week was to create a portfolio website that has information about myself, my work, and contact information This portfolio was designed to provide future employers look at my completed work and thought process for how I work on a project. The portfolio starts with My name, then gives a navigation bar to take the user to the area of the website they need to observe. After the nav bar are my work projects with links that take the users directly to the project themselves. After comes the section that provides information on how to contact me. Finally at the bottom is where you'll find the resume section (Resume to be included soon). Problems that I solved while working on this project had to do with media queries, getting the right size for my work to fit the screen. What I learned from this project is that I need to improve on my understanding of some of the css properties in order utilize them for future projects.   

## Installation

I started with creating a new repository git hub for the remote repository, after I cloned the repository from github to make a local repository. Then I added an index.html file, an assets with a css file inside on vs code and pushed them to the remote repository on github. First using the gitpull command to make sure the repositories were up to date, then using the git add, commit, then push command to add all the extra files that I added from gitbash.  

## Usage

When navigating the portfolio the user can see the nav bar on the top right hand side of the page. There will be links that when clicked will take the user directly to the section of the website that they want to navigate to. in the work section of the portfolio there will be the first project tab that when clicked will take the user to the deployed project that I first worked on. When adjusting the screen size of the webpage the user will notice the change of the work section adjusting so that the content does not become unreadable. The headers of the page change color as well when the screen size is adjusted. At the top of the webpage the user will see my name and avatar that was placed instead of a picture. Finally at the bottom of the webpage the user will see a contact me section and resume section that are still a work in progress.
